EBICS Java Client
=====

Heavily modified version of - https://sourceforge.net/p/ebics/


Main differences with this fork:

- Support for French, German and Swiss banks
- Command line client to do the setup, initialization and to download files from the bank
- Use of maven for compilation instead of ant + Makefile + .sh scripts


As of now the code is in very early stages.
DO NOT use in production.
